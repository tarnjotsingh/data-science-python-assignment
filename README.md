# CS3PD18 Assignment

Git project for the python assignment.

## Task 1: 

- Load the metro.csv file into a pandas data frame.

- Find a sensible way to remove the missing values from the data frame, and explain why you have chosen this method.

- Explore the distribution of the duration variable. You should produce a plot visualising the distribution, and calculate and discuss briefly statistics of the variable.

- Produce a plot showing how the distribution of duration relates to passh-older type.

- Perform an appropriate statistical test to check if the mean duration is different between One Day Pass and Flex Pass passholders.  What assumptions have you made by using this test?

- Convert the start_time and end_time columns to date objects if they are not already.

- Create a new column in the data frame that gives the hour of the day that each journey started on.

- Explore how the duration variable varies between each journey starting hour of the day, creating a plot to visualise this.

- Explore how the distribution of the duration variable varies between each day of the week, creating a plot to visualise this.

- Calculate the total numbers of passholders of each type travelling on each week day. Discuss the results.

## Task 2:

- Load the seeds.csv file into a pandas data frame

- Use scikitlearn to find a Gaussian mixture model to the data, with 2 components. Describe Gaussian mixture models and interpret the results.

- Generate a scatter plot of compactness against groove length, showing the resulting cluster membership.

- Use an appropriate criterion (or several) to compare Gaussian mixture model clusterings with between 1 and 10 components. Discuss the resulsts and suggest the number of clusters you would choose and why.
